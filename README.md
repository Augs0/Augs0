## Hi, my name is August ☀️ I'm a multilingual developer who loves teaching~

### I'd love to get involved with any projects related to accessibility or tech for good 🦸‍♀️

🌍 Speak to me in: English, 日本語, Deutsch, español and 한국어. 

🌱 I’m currently learning React.js, - with some Gatsby.js for good measure - Python, and PHP. 

🎨 I am interested in all areas of development, but my strengths and preferences lie in front-end
